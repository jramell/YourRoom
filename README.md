## Back To Your Room

2D platformer about you having to go back to your room initially created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 37. The game got into the 10th percent most fun games of that jam. A few updates after that fixed a some bugs and added a parallaxed background. Additionally, I wrote a postmortem about it and published it on both ludumdare.com and my blog.

### Main goals

    -Practice for the Global Game Jam 2017 (achieved)
    -Learn how participating in a jam is like (achieved)
    -Test what I've learned until now (achieved)
