## PROJECT: Back To Your Room

PC Platformer about you having to go back to your room created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare # 37.

### Main goals

    -Practice for the Global Game Jam 2017 (achieved)
    -Learn how participating in a jam is like (achieved)
    -Test what I've learned until now (achieved)
    
### Current state

The game is currently in the "Judging" phase of the Ludum Dare # 37. Its entry can be found at http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=124127. It consists of one level demonstrating the mechanics.

### Future Work

    -I'm working on a visual update that'all add a proper background to the game
    -I'll publish a post-mortem of the game once the judging phase is over and I can analyze the total feedback I'll have received until then. It will be published in my blog at my portfolio (http://sergiomadera.portfoliobox.net/blog). This is in order to make the most of the exposure that participating in the Ludum Dare provides.
